# Lonely Sheep

5 sheeps sleeps in a place with N spaces for them to sleep.

Sheeps don't sleep alone: they must have either someone at their right or at the left.

The place is not circular, sheeps at borders only have one possible neighboor.

You must determine how many different ways you can arrange the sheep that meets these criteria for any N input value.
